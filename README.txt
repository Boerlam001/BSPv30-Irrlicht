BSPv30 Loader for Irrlicht

This project should be able to run on anything that can run Irrlicht.  I am currently using a random
pull of the 1.8 development branch, but hypothetically it should work with 1.7 too.

To use this you need an irrlicht based project, and you need to include cBSP30.h  You will also need a version 30 BSP file.

However, this loader is currently incomplete and if you try to use it you 
are crazy.

Portions of this project are taken from the irrlicht engine, copyright Nikolaus Gebhardt.
